Kmers (there may be zero or more of these entries):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
uint64_t    |  <W>  | binary kmer
uint32_t    | <col> | array of coverage values for colours 0..<col-1>

======
Notes:
======

* uint64_t is an 8 byte unsigned word
* uint32_t is a 4 byte unsigned word
* char is a 1 byte unsigned word
* unsigned long double is a 16 byte unsigned word

* All string are NOT null-terminated.

* <W> is set in the header, and is defined as the minimum number of 64 bit words
  required to store a kmer of length <kmer_size> bases (2 bits needed per base):

    W*32 >= kmer_size > (W-1)*32

  64 bit words are also known as uint64_t

* An 'Edge' char is an 8 bit bytes.  Each kmer has one of them for each colour
  (i.e. <col> of them).  The top 4 most significant bits represent edges to the
  left of the kmer and the 4 least significant bits represent edges to the right
  of the kmer.  

  Example: Kmer ACCGT has edge char 10100100 (i.e. 164 in decimal, or 0xA4 in hex)
        
    10100100
    | |  |
    tgcaACGT  (lowercase means before kmer, uppercase means after)
    t c  C  

  so this kmer if preceeded by a T or C and followed by a C: [TC]ACCGT[C]



*******************************
Binary File Format Version 5:
Identical for v4, except coverage is written as uint32_t.



*******************************
Binary File format Version 4:

Header: 6 chars (the word "CORTEX")
        1 int (version number)
        1 int (kmer size)
        1 int (number of long longs encoding the kmer)
        1 int (number of colours = num_cols)
        num_cols ints (mean read length for each colour)
        num_cols long longs (total sequence loaded into each colour)
        6 chars (the word "CORTEX")
Followed by consecutive nodes. Each node consists of:
        1 BinaryKmer (defined in include/basic/binary_kmer.h
        1 int (coverage)
        1 char (typedefed to Edges)
